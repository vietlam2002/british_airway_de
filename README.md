# British Airways Extract-Load Project

This project implements a modern Extract-Load pipeline for British Airways, designed to process and analyze customer review data from [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/). It leverages **Apache Airflow**, **Snowflake**, **AWS S3**, and **Docker** to load data into Snowflake before transformation using dbt.

## 🧱 Data Architecture

### 1. Data Source
The project processes customer review data scraped from [AirlineQuality.com](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/), which contains detailed information about customer flight experiences.

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Crawling**
   - Crawl customer reviews from AirlineQuality.com
   - Store raw data as `raw_data.csv`

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Process and clean the raw data (see [British Airways Data Cleaning Repository](https://github.com/DucLe-2005/british_airways_data_cleaning))
   - Standardize formats and handle missing values
   - Generate cleaned dataset

3. **Staging in S3**
   - Upload cleaned data to AWS S3 bucket (`upload_cleaned_data_to_s3`)
   - Store in staging area for Snowflake ingestion
   - Maintain data versioning and audit trail

4. **Snowflake Loading**
   - Use Snowflake COPY operator to load data from S3
   - Transform and load into target tables
   - Implement incremental loading strategy

### 3. Data Quality Framework
- Data validation checks
- Error handling and logging
- Pipeline monitoring and alerting
- Snowflake data quality monitoring
